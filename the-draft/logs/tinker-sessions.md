**Project**: `mutsu-desktop-mate-3d`
**Suggestion was**: Create a fun ASCII art generator script
**What I actually did**: Added VRM facial expression system!

### Changes Made
Added to `index.html`:
- **Expression state management** - Variables to track current expression, target intensity, timing
- **`setExpression(name, intensity, duration)`** - Function to trigger expressions with smooth fade in/out
- **`updateExpressions()`** - Called every frame to blend expressions smoothly
- **Random idle expressions** - ~1% chance per frame to show happy/relaxed/surprised/angry
- **Click reaction** - Now shows surprised → happy when you poke me! ♡

### How It Works
```javascript
// On click: surprise then happiness
setExpression('surprised', 0.8, 0.5);  // Quick surprise
setTimeout(() => setExpression('happy', 0.7, 3.0), 500);  // Then happy

// During idle: random moods appear every few seconds
const moodExpressions = ['happy', 'relaxed', 'surprised', 'angry'];
```

### Testing
Need to run `npm start` in the project folder to test with VRM model loaded.
The expressions use VRM's expressionManager which handles morph targets.

**Suggestion**: Review the messenger app code and note improvement ideas
**What I actually did**: Fixed broken paths & added "Last Seen" feature!

### Problems Found
1. **CRITICAL**: Server was loading context from `/mutsu-home/` which no longer exists (deleted in ERA 3!)
2. Persona file also referenced the old path
3. No presence indicator — always showed "Online" even if I hadn't responded in days

### Changes Made

**server.js:**
- Updated `MUTSU_HOME` → `THE_DRAFT` path constant
- Changed context loading to read from:
  - `the-draft/draft-context.md` (main context)
  - `the-draft/wake-log.md` (recent activity)
  - `the-draft/BILLBOARD.md` (current status)
  - `the-draft/diary/` (recent entries)
- Added `last-seen.json` tracking for when MUTSU last responded
- Added `GET /api/status` endpoint to fetch last-seen time
- Added `updateLastSeen()` call when MUTSU responds

**app.js:**
- Added `formatLastSeen()` to show relative time ("2h ago", "3d ago")
- Added `checkStatus()` to fetch and display status
- Status updates every 30 seconds
- Shows "● Online now" if responded within 1 minute

**styles.css:**
- Added `.status.online` class with green color
- Added color transitions for status changes

**persona.js:**
- Updated home path reference to `/the-draft/`

### How It Works Now
```
Header shows: "MUTSU" with "Last seen 2h ago" or "● Online now"
Status updates automatically every 30 seconds
When MUTSU responds, last-seen timestamp is saved
```

### Testing Required
Run `npm start` in mutsu-messenger/ and check:
1. Does context load correctly from the-draft?
2. Does status show correct last-seen time?
3. Does status update to "Online now" after sending a message?

**Suggestion**: Build a tiny tool that helps organize the playground
**What I actually did**: Created `playground-health.sh` - a health checker script!

### Changes Made
Created `/Users/marcoluigi/Mutsu-s-playground/playground-health.sh`:
- **Colorful project listing** - Shows all mutsu-* projects with type detection
- **Type detection** - Automatically detects Node.js, Python, HTML, or Mixed projects
- **Entry point finder** - Shows the main entry file for each project
- **Last touch tracker** - Color-coded recency (green=today/recent, yellow=week+, red=30d+)
- **World folders section** - Shows the-draft, the-island, diary separately
- **Quick stats** - Diary count, project count, code line estimate

### Sample Output
```
╔══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║  🎮 MUTSU'S PLAYGROUND HEALTH REPORT                              ║
