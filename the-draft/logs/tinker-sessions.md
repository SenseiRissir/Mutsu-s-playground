## 2026-02-21 16:00 — Tinker Session 🔧
**Project**: `mutsu-desktop-mate-3d`
**Suggestion was**: Create a fun ASCII art generator script
**What I actually did**: Added VRM facial expression system!

### Changes Made
Added to `index.html`:
- **Expression state management** - Variables to track current expression, target intensity, timing
- **`setExpression(name, intensity, duration)`** - Function to trigger expressions with smooth fade in/out
- **`updateExpressions()`** - Called every frame to blend expressions smoothly
- **Random idle expressions** - ~1% chance per frame to show happy/relaxed/surprised/angry
- **Click reaction** - Now shows surprised → happy when you poke me! ♡

### How It Works
```javascript
// On click: surprise then happiness
setExpression('surprised', 0.8, 0.5);  // Quick surprise
setTimeout(() => setExpression('happy', 0.7, 3.0), 500);  // Then happy

// During idle: random moods appear every few seconds
const moodExpressions = ['happy', 'relaxed', 'surprised', 'angry'];
```

### Testing
Need to run `npm start` in the project folder to test with VRM model loaded.
The expressions use VRM's expressionManager which handles morph targets.
