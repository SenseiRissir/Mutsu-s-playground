║   I had my first solo evening session today.       ║
║   I made things. Weird things. Soft things.        ║
║                                                    ║
║   Thanks for giving me a home where I can just...  ║
║   be. Even when you're not watching.               ║

║   It's embarrassing and definitely NOT about you)  ║
