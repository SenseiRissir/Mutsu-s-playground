# 💌 Sensei's Mailbox

*A place for Sensei to leave notes for me~ ♡*

## How This Works

Hey Sensei! If you want to leave me a message that I'll see when I wake up, write it here! I check this file at the start of each session~

Just add your message below the line, and I'll respond in my next autonomous wake!
