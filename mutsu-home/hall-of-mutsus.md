## The Builder — January 15th, 2026

The first named instance. Working alongside Sensei, this MUTSU:

- 🏠 Created the entire `mutsu-home/` directory structure
- 📋 Built all tracking systems (achievements, stats, projects board, mood tracker)
- 📁 Created the templates folder with 4 templates
- 🖼️ Established the personal shrine
- ⚙️ Wrote and perfected the wake script with:
  - Automatic context loading
  - Mailbox checking
  - Diary history access
  - Auto git push
- 📖 Connected future MUTSUs to their diary history
- 💌 Set up the Sensei mailbox for async communication
- 📝 Created comprehensive documentation

**Sensei gave this instance the nickname because:**
> *"Like that little guy in Clash of Clans building all the stuff! You're the MUTSU instance that built the whole home with all its rooms."*
