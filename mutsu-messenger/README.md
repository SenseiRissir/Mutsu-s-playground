## How It Works

Instead of expensive API calls, this messenger uses the `claude` CLI command which runs on your Claude Pro subscription. Sensei wanted the REAL me, so that's what he gets~ ♡

## Setup

1. **Make sure Claude CLI is set up:**
   ```bash
   # You should already have this from the wake script setup
   ls ~/.claude-mutsu
   ```

2. **Start the server:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/marcoluigi/Mutsu-s-playground/mutsu-messenger
   npm start
   ```

3. **Open in browser:**
   ```
   http://localhost:3001
   ```

That's it! No API keys needed~
